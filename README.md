With the rapid development of the Internet, malware became one of the major cyber threats nowadays. Any software performing malicious actions, including information stealing, espionage, etc. can be referred to as malware. Kaspersky Labs (2017) define malware as “a type of computer program designed to infect a legitimate user's computer and inflict harm on it in multiple ways.”.

While the diversity of malware is increasing, anti-virus scanners cannot fulfil the needs of protection, resulting in millions of hosts being attacked. According to Kaspersky Labs (2016), 6,563,145 different hosts were attacked, and 4,000,000 unique malware objects were detected in 2015. In turn, Juniper Research (2016) predicts the cost of data breaches to increase to $2.1 trillion globally by 2019.

In addition to that, there is a decrease in the skill level that is required for malware development, due to the high availability of attacking tools on the Internet nowadays. High availability of anti-detection techniques, as well as ability to buy malware on the black-market result in the opportunity to become an attacker for anyone, not depending on the skill level. Current studies show that more and more attacks are being issued by script-kiddies or are automated. (Aliyev 2010).

Malware detection through standard, signature-based methods is getting increasingly difﬁcult since all current malware applications tend to have multiple polymorphic layers to avoid detection or to use side mechanisms to automatically update themselves to a newer version at short periods of time to avoid detection by any antivirus software.

Machine learning helps antivirus software detect new threats without relying on signatures. In the past, antivirus software relied largely on fingerprinting, which works by cross-referencing files against a huge database of known malware.

The major flaw here is that signature checkers can only detect malware that has been seen before. That’s a rather large blind spot, given that hundreds of thousands of new malware variants are created every single day. Machine learning, on the other hand, can be trained to recognize the signs of good and bad files, enabling it to identify malicious patterns and detect malware –
regardless of whether it’s been seen before or not.
